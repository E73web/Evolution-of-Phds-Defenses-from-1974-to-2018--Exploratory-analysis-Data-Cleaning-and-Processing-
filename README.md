This dataset is about PhDs thesis defended from 1974 to  2020.

I firstly cleaned the dataset before studying the data itself. 
I looked for missing date and checked for possible pattern and correlation between present and missing data.
I studied the distribution of Phds defenses through months and year building several plots to display quantities, means, and standard deviations
Also I studied the presence of outliers and their impact on defenses distributions.
I finally observed the evolution of language and PhDs thesis online access in time.
