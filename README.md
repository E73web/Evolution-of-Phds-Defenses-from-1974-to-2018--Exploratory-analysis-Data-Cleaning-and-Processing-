This dataset is about PhDs thesis defended from 1974 to  2020.

I firstly cleaned the dataset before studying the data itself. 
I looked for missing date and checked for possible pattern and correlation between present and missing data.
Also I studied the presence of outliers and observed the evolution of language and online access in time.
